    <th>Between 1819 and 1822, Babbage built his first small model of the calculating engine (Difference Engine 0). Powered by cranking a handle, the machine calculated and printed mathematical tables.<br>The machine was called a <q>difference engine</q> after the mathematical theory on which the machine's operation was based.</th>

  <tr>
    <th>The Difference Engine No.1 was designed to calculate and tabulate polynomial functions. Babbage was given 1,700 pounds by the British Government to begin constructing a full scale machine. Over the years more than 10 times this amount of money was spent on the project.<br>In 1832, a small working portion was built. In 1833, work on the full scale difference engine was stopped. <q>If the machine had been built it would have had over 25,000 working parts, weighted over 13 metric tons and have been over 8 feet (2.4m) tall.</q></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>In 1837, Babbage became interested in building a more ambitious analytical engine that would be more powerful than the original difference engine. This would be the first working computer for general-purpose computation.<br>It would use punched cards for programming. A trial part was built but was never fully completed. He also designed a printer for his new engine.</th>

    <th>In 1842, the government decided to stop funding the projects.</th>

    <th>From 1846 to 1849, Babbage designed a new improved difference engine (Difference Engine No. 2).</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>These machines were considered the <q>very first mechanical computers</q> to be invented. They were not built due to a lack of funding, and not due to any design flaw. The basic concept of his machines was similar to the modern computer which lead to him being called <q>the father of the computer</q>.</th>
